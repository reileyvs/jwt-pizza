<h2>My Curiosity Report</h2>

I am writing my curiosity report on ways for someone to get free AWS credits to use. There were a couple ways I found that work to get free credit, or get access to normally paid features for free. This is a list of them:
<ul>
  <li>
    AWS Educate
  </li>
  <li>
    AWS Activate
  </li>
  <li>
    AWS EdStart
  </li>
  <li>
    AWS Cloud-Credit for Research
  </li>
  <li>
    Non-Profit Credit Program
  </li>
  <li>
    Attending AWS events
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>AWS Educate</h3>
This is a program for students. If eligible, you get access to a lot of tutorials and labs that teach you about how to use different AWS technologies, though you can't use that credit for your own personal projects.

<h3>AWS Activate</h3>
This is a program designed for startups. There are two separate types Founder and Portfolio that can help you depending on if your startup is funded or self-funded.

<h3>AWS EdStart</h3>
This program is also for startups, but specifically EdTech startups that are helping education with the startup

<h3>AWS Cloud-Credit for Research</h3>
PhD students or other qualified researchers can gain AWS credit for doing research

<h3>Non-Profit Credit Program</h3>
Many non-profit organizations can apply for this program, and depending, can get a decent amount of credit to keep them going.

<h3>Attending AWS events</h3>
At times, Amazon will give credits to attendees of certain webinars or events.

This was very informative for me, especially because I just got into Sandbox and so may need to take advantage of their free credits for startups!
