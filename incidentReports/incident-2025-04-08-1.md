# Incident:  2025-04-08 10-34-00

## Summary

```md
**Incident**:

Between the hour of 10:34 and 12:37 on April 8th, 2025, 149 users encountered failed pizza creation. The event was triggered by an error in the factory at 10:34am. The error in the factory caused all pizzas to start failing when created.

A bug in this code caused users to be unable to buy pizzas. The event was detected by Grafana Metrics when the FAILED_PIZZAS metric began to rise. The team started working on the event by checking the factory docs and trying to send curl requests, and then by talking to a TA. This severe incident affected 100% of users for the 2 hours affected.

There was further impact as noted by angry protesters storming our office in the Bay Area and demanding USB drives with their pizzas installed.
```

## Detection

```md
This incident was detected when the Grafana FAILED_PIZZAS metric began to rise and Vincent Reiley happened to be watching at around 18:25 UTC.

Unfortunately, no alert was automatically raised by Grafana, as we had only put an alert on sold pizzas, but not on failed pizzas.

We have promptly added an alert for failed pizzas and reviewed existing alerts for improvements to illicit a more immediate response in the case of a future failure.
```

## Impact

```md
For 2h 3m between 17:34 UTC and 19:37 UTC on April 8th, 2025, users were unable to purchase pizzas. 149 of our users experienced this incident.

This incident affected 149 customers (100% OF JWT PIZZA USERS), who experienced receiving a "Failed to create pizza" factory error.

No lives were lost in the Battle for the Bay Area Office, though we will need to purchase more thumb drives.

```

## Response

```md
After taking a shower, Vincent (see official title above) came online at 18:25 UTC in Grafana Metrics.

Although this engineer had a background in the Grafana Metrics and website service, a clear answer was not apparent, so a second alert was sent at 19:00 UTC to Ethan Waite who came into the room at 19:10 UTC.
```

## Root cause

```md
A triggered change to chaos type. An automated ticket sending system would be helpful for creating an immediate request for help from the factory department
```

## Resolution

```md
By clicking on chaos resolution link, all systems returned to normality. This was confirmed by no more failed pizzas
```

## Prevention

```md
This issue can also happen to other metrics, so all alerts were evaluated on their effectiveness
```

## Action items

```md

1. Alert on every metrics value
2. Evaluation of factory team and possible layoffs
3. Vincent Reiley (see official title above) is responsible for immediate response, and factory team for fixing the issue as soon as possible
```
